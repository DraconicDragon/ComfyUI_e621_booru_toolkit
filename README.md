# ComfyUI e621 booru Toolkit

this repo and the nodes may be called toolkit, but after making the single node that just fetches a post's image and tags i dont know what to add anymore so ill probably rename the repo to whatever fits to what it currently does, post fetcher or something

For now: just custom node to fetch tags from a given danbooru e621 post link (and sites with api responses similar to danbooru)
