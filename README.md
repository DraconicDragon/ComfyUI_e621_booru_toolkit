# ComfyUI e621 booru Toolkit

~~For now just~~ has a custom node to fetch tags from a given danbooru e621 post link (and sites with api responses similar to danbooru)

new-ish: theres a node thats kinda barebones but it takes in a tag and outputs the wiki page of that tag, i want it to work with a button but idk javascript :(
